# Project

## Progress

This project is finally complete!  The game is called "Zombie Massacre" and it is a shooting/dodging game where the player uses WASD to control the player, avoid and shoot zombies.  There is even a boss Zombie in the end!

## Main Theme

The main theme of this game is to avoid and shoot incoming zombies.  It is a clicking game where you kill a zombie by clicking it.

## My Comments

### 07/08/15

So, I never thought that we would already be asked to start planning our project as early as ```07/08/15```.  Maybe that's a good thing - to create a decent project, at least a week's preparation work is necessary.  I am glad to be able to create the Javascript code for this game - it is fun yet challenging.

Our group has finally officially started creating the long-awaited project.  At first, there were a lot of ideas as to what the game should be like (I won't mention it here since time is already running out) but in the end we decided that it would be a dodge-and-shoot game.  More details will be revealed in the future.

Our group project has finally been completed!  The game is now officially called "Zombie Massacre" and the main objective of the game is to avoid zombies and shoot them down before they reach you.  The game is not endless - there is a boss at the end and when the boss is defeated, you win.

The entire Javascript code for the game is almost ```800``` lines of code - something I have not achieved before.

The game has been tested to be bug-free :D
