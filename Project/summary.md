## My Comments

So, I never thought that we would already be asked to start planning our project as early as ```07/08/15```.  Maybe that's a good thing - to create a decent project, at least a week's preparation work is necessary.  I am glad to be able to create the Javascript code for this game - it is fun yet challenging.
