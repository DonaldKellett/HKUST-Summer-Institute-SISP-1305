## Homework

Create a game in which a "monster" (SVG character) moves to a random point in the browser window every 0.5 seconds (```500``` milliseconds).  The objective of the game is for the player to click on the monster as quickly as possible.  As the monster moves around the browser window, the number of times it moves around the window should be kept in a variable called ```count```.  The game ends as soon as the player clicks on the monster and a success message is displayed to the player (in ```.svg``` format, not Javascript alerts) according to the number of times the monster moved before the player clicked on the monster.
