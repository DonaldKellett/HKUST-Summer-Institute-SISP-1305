# HKUST Summer Institute - Internet Game Development for Beginners (SISP 1305)

This repo will contain all of my major coding projects from the HKUST Summer Institute (SISP 1305) Summer Programme.

## Overview

According to the professor/course instructor *Dr. Gibson*, the following coding languages will be taught in the course:

 - SVG
 - Python

However, later on during the first lesson, *Dr. Gibson* stated that SVG files can be manipulated using Javascript, so at the moment I am not sure whether Python or Javascript will be taught in the course.  Either way, I will learn new stuff during this Summer Programme since SVG files are new to me.
