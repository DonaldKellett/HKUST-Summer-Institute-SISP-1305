# Lab 2

## Homework

Create a number-guessing game using Javascript within a ```.svg``` file.  To do this, first create ```<script>``` tags.  Then, within the script tags, add ```<![CDATA[``` and ```]]>``` before typing in the custom Javascript functions between those two expressions.  To call the custom functions when the page is loaded, use the ```onload``` attribute within the ```<svg>``` tag.  A template SVG file has been created to aid the homework task.

## My Comments

So after the first two labs (Lab 0 and Lab 1), the second programming language we are going to learn in this course has finally been revealed!  It turns out that we will be taught ```Javascript``` (which I am already quite familiar with) instead of ```Python``` in the next few lessons, despite statements made during the first lab.  Anyway, I've still learned quite a lot because SVG is totally new to me (except for the format itself which is quite similar to HTML) and I still do not know everything about Javascript.
